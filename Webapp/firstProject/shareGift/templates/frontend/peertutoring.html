            ​Since schools are closed, students can’t ask teachers for help as they normally would.  We are providing a tutoring service to help students as we adapt to a life of closed schools or online learning, through an APP, Meetup Study Buddy as well as a website. Meetup Study Buddy matches selected high school tutors to students for thirty minutes to one-hour private tutoring sessions via Zoom. We came up with the idea after receiving an email from a classmate who needed help. Many students were suddenly lost and uncertain and many schools haven’t even made their online courses official curriculum, but rather just ‘enrichment.’ Simply, it’s not enough. There’s a need for a supplement.  We thought that schools shutting down or transitioning to remote learning might be especially difficult for high schoolers who are starting the college application process and planning to take AP tests. At the beginning of March, we sent out emails to gauge student interest and areas of expertise. There were more than 100 responses, and respondents were added to a google doc to coordinate the interview and selection process.
