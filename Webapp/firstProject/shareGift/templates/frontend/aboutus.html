            Share Gift was originally founded in Seoul, South Korea in 2015 and now has carried over to the Bay Area on a global scale. Our goal is to share our gifts we were privileged enough to have with those in need of our community, whether that is categorized as education, financial wealth, or even things that we usually take for granted like working arms and legs or proper sight and hearing. Our vision is to start with these small actions in our community which we believe will ultimately leave a positive impact around the world. Through advocacy and outreach activities, our team works tirelessly to contribute our part to the greater good. Having been established for five years as of 2020, Share Gift has expanded to five chapters globally with over 500+ members.

            Our organization mainly targets four different stakeholders: senior patients, homeless families, the death and blind, and low-income students. For senior patients, we regularly visit them to keep them company. For homeless families, we organize drives to donate medical essentials and goods. For the death and blind community, we spread awareness through the American Sign Language club and remotely help them through our ‘SHAREEE’ app. For low-income students, we provide free tutoring sessions online through our MeetUpStudyBuddy program.
